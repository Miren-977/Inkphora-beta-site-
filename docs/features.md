# Inkphora — Features Overview

Inkphora is an experimental empathic AI music oracle.

It is powered by the proprietary Inkphora Gesture-Affect Engine™, a non-biometric framework that interprets freehand touch dynamics into affective signals.

This system transforms finger gestures into poetic reflections and personalised music paths.

## 1. Gesture Capture

Users draw directly with their finger on a mobile touchscreen.

The system interprets the rhythm, flow, and direction of the stroke as expressive signals.

We do NOT collect:
- biometric data
- camera input
- microphone input
- wearable signals

Interaction is entirely gesture-based and intentional.

---

## 2. Poetic Reflection

Each gesture is translated into a short poetic interpretation.

The reflection is:
- symbolic
- non-diagnostic
- non-clinical
- emotionally evocative

It serves as a mirror of the moment — not a psychological evaluation.

---

## 3. Emotion Dynamics

Gesture dynamics are mapped into a simplified affective model inspired by valence–arousal theory.

This creates a visible emotional orientation such as:
- calm vs energetic
- expansive vs contained
- fluid vs structured

This mapping is experimental and research-oriented.

## 4. Empathic Music Path

From the reflection, users can explore a curated music direction:
- raga-inspired
- classical
- ambient

The goal is aesthetic resonance and emotional regulation through sound.

## 5. Mobile-First Interaction

Inkphora requires:
- a smartphone
- touchscreen input
- direct finger drawing

Desktop is not recommended.
