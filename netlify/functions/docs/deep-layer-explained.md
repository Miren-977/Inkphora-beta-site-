Inkphora.ai — Deep Concept & Transparency Layer

Public Technical & Conceptual Explanation (v1.0)
Last updated: 2026-02-18

Scope:
This document defines key concepts visible on the website and used by the assistant.
If a concept is not defined here, the assistant must not speculate.

1. Core Experience Concepts
Empathic AI

Empathic AI in this context means a system designed to reflect emotional dynamics in a symbolic and non-clinical way.

It does not:

diagnose

assess mental health

analyze personality

replace therapy

It provides a reflective interface based on expressive interaction.

Oracle (in this context)

The “Oracle” is not mystical or predictive.

It refers to a short symbolic output generated from gesture-based signals.
It acts as a poetic mirror of the moment.

The oracle:

does not predict the future

does not provide advice

does not issue instructions

does not make medical claims

It is reflective language, not authority.

Gesture

A gesture is a freehand movement drawn on a touchscreen.

The system captures the rhythm and flow of the stroke and translates it into abstract movement descriptors.

Important:

It is not handwriting analysis.

It does not analyze meaning of written words.

It focuses on movement dynamics.

Rhythm and Flow of the Stroke

“Rhythm” refers to how the movement unfolds over time.

It may include:

speed variation

pauses

smoothness vs fragmentation

acceleration patterns

continuity vs interruption

It describes movement structure, not artistic quality.

Emotion Dynamics

Emotion Dynamics refers to how movement qualities are mapped into a simplified affective space.

The system uses a minimal model based on:

Valence (pleasant ↔ unpleasant)

Arousal (calm ↔ activated)

These are used as interpretative dimensions.

They are not clinical measurements and should not be understood as psychological diagnostics.

Poetic Reflection

Each gesture is translated into a short poetic sentence.

This reflection:

is symbolic

is non-directive

avoids diagnosis

avoids advice

mirrors the moment

It is meant to support self-awareness, not prescribe action.

Poetic Integration

Poetic Integration is the controlled generative step that transforms movement-derived signals into poetic language.

It includes:

Signal simplification (movement → affective dimensions)

Style constraints (short, symbolic, non-prescriptive)

Safety boundaries (no medical claims)

Coherence control (avoid random or chaotic output)

Poetic Integration is a design principle guiding how signals become language.

Empathic Music Path

After receiving the poetic reflection, users can explore curated music suggestions aligned with the same simplified affect space.

Music categories may include:

Raga

Classical

Ambient

The goal is to nurture balance and emotional grounding.

Music suggestions are supportive, not therapeutic prescriptions.

2. Music Concepts
Raga

A Raga is a melodic framework in Indian classical music.

It is not simply a scale.
A raga includes:

a defined set of notes

characteristic melodic movements

expressive mood associations

sometimes a traditional time of day

In this project, raga-inspired music is offered as a contemplative listening option.

The system does not analyze traditional raga theory.
Curated tracks are used to support reflective states.

Classical Music

Classical music refers to Western instrumental and orchestral traditions characterized by structured composition and harmonic development.

In this project, classical music may be suggested to provide emotional structure and grounding.

Ambient Music

Ambient music is atmospheric sound designed to create space rather than strong rhythmic focus.

It is often associated with:

relaxation

reduced overstimulation

sustained calm presence

3. What We Collect (Beta Transparency)

During the beta trial, we may collect:

Email (for waitlist or beta communication)

Anonymous stroke features

Brief self-reports of mood

We do NOT store:

Raw drawings

Personal biometric identifiers

Third-party tracking data

Anonymous Stroke Features

Anonymous stroke features are lightweight numeric descriptors derived from movement.

Examples may include:

total stroke length

average speed

speed variation

pause ratio

direction change density

spatial bias

Exact formulas and mapping logic are proprietary.

The raw drawing itself is not stored.

4. Minimal Feature Concept (Public Explanation)

The system reduces complex movement into simplified indicators.

These indicators:

describe movement behavior

do not contain personal identity

are used only as abstract signals

are aggregated for improvement

No personality profiling is performed.

5. Legal & Transparency Layer

The beta operates under consent.

Data is used to:

provide beta access

improve the model in aggregate

inform participants about updates

Users may:

unsubscribe

request deletion

request information about stored data

This is an experimental research prototype.

6. Context-Only Answering Policy

The assistant is retrieval-based.

It can only answer using concepts explicitly defined in available documentation.

If a concept is not documented, the assistant should say:

“I cannot find a definition of that term in the current documentation.”

This prevents invented explanations.

7. Known Limitations

Finger-based gestures are device-dependent.

Freehand input is not standardized.

Interpretations are symbolic.

This is not a clinical system.

Emotional mappings are simplified.

8. FAQ Retrieval Anchors

Q: What does “rhythm and flow” mean?
A: It refers to how movement unfolds over time, including speed variation and pauses.

Q: What is Poetic Integration?
A: It is the controlled step that translates simplified movement signals into symbolic poetic language.

Q: Do you analyze handwriting meaning?
A: No. The system analyzes movement dynamics, not semantic handwriting content.

Q: Are emotions scientifically detected?
A: The system uses a simplified valence–arousal framework for interpretation, not clinical measurement.

Q: What is a raga?
A: A raga is a melodic framework from Indian classical music associated with specific expressive moods.

Q: Why suggest raga music?
A: Because raga-based music can support contemplative and reflective emotional states.

Q: What does “oracle” mean here?
A: It refers to a symbolic reflective output, not prediction or authority.

Q: What are anonymous stroke features?
A: Lightweight numeric movement descriptors derived from gesture input, without storing the drawing itself.
